### How I installed the Library

I installed it as external code in a `<script>` element at the end of my HTML file, but I also had to include the CSS files in the head section of my HTML
  - This was done using a CDN (Content Delivery Network)

Goal: Install Fullpage JS Library:

For some reason that was oddly difficult, for a while I wasn't sure which links I had to copy and paste into my html file so when I was looking at the list on [this page](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/fullPage.js) I didn't know which one to use.

- Ended up using `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullPage.js/3.1.2/fullpage.min.css` and
- `<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/fullPage.js/3.1.2/fullpage.min.js" integrity="sha512-gSf3NCgs6wWEdztl1e6vUqtRP884ONnCNzCpomdoQ0xXsk06lrxJsR7jX5yM/qAGkPGsps+4bLV5IEjhOZX+gg==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>`

Once I got that working, making a demonstration was pretty simple, and making the page slide was cool.

Before I decided on using fullpage I wanted to try anime but it seemed very complicated haha.
